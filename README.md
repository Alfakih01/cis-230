Brief Summary of Client and Requirements:
The Gaming Room is the client, and they required a RESTful API with basic authentication and authorization for user access. The software design involved creating a user interface for entering authentication data, securing REST APIs using annotations, implementing username/password-based authentication and role-based authorization, and creating a protected REST application with specific access controls.

Strengths in Documentation Development:
I ensured that I followed the provided instructions thoroughly and accurately, translating the tasks into a coherent development plan. I also made sure to highlight key areas such as creating the user interface, implementing authentication and authorization, and testing the application. Clear and descriptive explanations of the project structure and steps were important in making the documentation easy to follow.

Helpfulness of Design Document Process:
Working through a design document was helpful as it provided a structured approach to tackling the project. It broke down the tasks into smaller, manageable components, helping me focus on each part separately. The design document acted as a roadmap, making the development process smoother by guiding me through each step.

Part to Revise and Improvement:
If I were to revise something in the documentation, it would be to include more contextual explanations and reasoning behind the choices made during the implementation. Providing insights into why specific design decisions were made, such as choosing particular annotations or approaches, could enhance the documentation's educational value.

Interpreting User Needs and Importance of User-Centered Design:
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully following the project requirements, implementing each aspect of the API with authentication and authorization, and ensuring that the final application satisfied the desired security and access controls. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures that the software addresses the client's objectives and provides a secure and user-friendly experience for the end-users.

Approach to Designing Software and Future Techniques:
I approached designing software by first understanding the project requirements, breaking them down into smaller tasks, and then systematically implementing each part while keeping best practices in mind. In the future, I would continue to analyze requirements thoroughly, design modular components, and follow a step-by-step approach to ensure that each functionality is well-implemented and tested. Additionally, I would seek to leverage automated testing frameworks to ensure robustness and reliability in the codebase.
